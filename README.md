## Overview

The S&P 500 Index Fund Price Predictor is a project that leverages the Random Forest algorithm to forecast the price of the S&P 500 index fund. The project includes data preprocessing, splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, training the Random Forest model, and backtesting the model's accuracy. The final accuracy achieved is approximately 0.56, indicating its potential for predicting S&P 500 index fund prices.


## Introduction

Predicting the price of financial instruments like the S&P 500 index fund is a challenging and essential task for investors and traders. This project aims to provide a predictive model that can assist in making informed investment decisions.

This README file provides essential information about the project, including how to set it up, use it, and understand its performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains historical data related to the S&P 500 index fund, including features such as past fund prices. The dataset can be obtained from kaggle.

## Model Performance

The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of approximately 0.56 during backtesting. While this accuracy provides valuable insights, it's essential to consider additional evaluation metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), to assess the model's overall performance. The model has much work to be done on it to acheive  a better precision score.

Additionally, consider employing different feature engineering techniques, hyperparameter tuning, or trying alternative machine learning algorithms to further improve predictive accuracy.
